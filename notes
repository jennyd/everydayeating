#### planned apps

# food: add and edit basic foods (which are for our purposes in infinite supply)

# dish: add, edit and duplicate dishes, which are collections of fixed quantities of foods and/or other dishes

# users: user accounts...

# linkusers: allow portions of dishes to be sent to linked users

# diary: assign foods and dishes to times and dates, both past and future

# restaurant: allow diary entries with estimated calorie counts, which won't appear in later search results (and can't be duplicated?)

# shoppinglist: produce a list of foods in all dishes until a specified point in the future

# pots: enter names & weights of owned pans & bowls, and use them to simplify calculation of dish quantities

# zerocalories: add and edit a user-specific list of foods which should be treated as having 0 calories, and don't require quantities to be specified

# recipe: edit and display a dish as a recipe, with instructions, extra pictures and ability to publish/share it

# visualisetheveg: calculate the weight of vegetables in diary over a period of time and scale images of those vegetables to represent quantities consumed

# caloriesources: visually represent sources of calories (meat, carb, fat etc) over a period of time

#### things which would be awesome to do

# show most recently used ingredients first in search results
# autocomplete/suggest searches
# search for dishes/meals from the last 3 months (or this time last year) containing particular (combinations of) ingredients
# show graphs of how much vegetable/meat etc was eaten in the last week etc (i want to see giant vegetables :) )
# show graphs of where calories come from (fat, carbs etc)
# dish ratings:
#    - 1 star: not great, don't make again like this (automatically exclude from searches?)
#    - 2 stars: good, make again, perhaps with variations
#    - 3 stars: really good, make again just like this
