#### to do

# validate portion.quantity, if portion.comestible.is_dish:
#     - result of portion.comestible.dish.get_remaining_quantity() should
#         never be less than 0
#     - portions are created/edited by:
#         - meal_portion_form view, using inline formset
#             - portion.quantity is validated by ModelForm, since it's editable
#         - meal_duplicate, using portion.clone() then portion.save()
#             - not automatically validated on save - where to add validation?
#         - dish_portions view (not yet written), perhaps using inline formset?
#             - should be validated by ModelForm, since portion.quantity is
#               editable
#     - also needs to validate when dish.quantity changes, and ask whether to
#         edit portions if they exceed the new dish.quantity

# make most views login_required and restricted to user.household
# and make household- and user-based views & templates

# rename related_name on contained_comestible?

# view to create & edit portions of a dish

# view to convert a portion of a dish to an amount in another dish

# view to convert some portions from a meal to a new dish with amounts

# validation: prevent a dish having the same name as an ingredient

# add a comment field to Amount, for e.g. preparation instructions

# add get_week_start(date): while (date - 1).week == date.week: date -= 1
    - use in get_avg_week_calories to make it work for any date, not assuming it's being given a week start?

#### planned apps

# food: add and edit basic foods (which are for our purposes in infinite supply)

# dish: add, edit and duplicate dishes, which are collections of fixed quantities of foods and/or other dishes

# diary: assign foods and dishes to times and dates, both past and future

# fridge/freezer: keep track of cooked dishes/portions in the fridge/freezer, with dates by which they should be eaten

# restaurant: allow diary entries with estimated calorie counts, which won't appear in later search results (and can't be duplicated?)

# shoppinglist: produce a list of foods in all dishes until a specified point in the future

# pots: enter names & weights of owned pans & bowls, and use them to simplify calculation of dish quantities

# zerocalories: add and edit a user-specific list of foods which should be treated as having 0 calories, and don't require quantities to be specified

# recipe: edit and display a dish as a recipe, with instructions, extra pictures and ability to publish/share it

# visualisetheveg: calculate the weight of vegetables in diary over a period of time and scale images of those vegetables to represent quantities consumed

# caloriesources: visually represent sources of calories (meat, carb, fat etc) over a period of time

# users: user accounts...

# linkusers: allow portions of dishes to be sent to linked users

#### things which would be awesome to do

# show most recently used ingredients first in search results
# autocomplete/suggest searches
# search for dishes/meals from the last 3 months (or this time last year) containing particular (combinations of) ingredients
# show graphs of how much vegetable/meat etc was eaten in the last week etc (i want to see giant vegetables :) )
# show graphs of where calories come from (fat, carbs etc)
# dish ratings:
#    - 1 star: not great, don't make again like this (automatically exclude from searches?)
#    - 2 stars: good, make again, perhaps with variations
#    - 3 stars: really good, make again just like this
